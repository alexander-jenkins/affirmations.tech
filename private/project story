## Inspiration
During the schoolyear, our days start to feel very monotonous as we juggle studying, homework, project deadlines, and other responsibilities. It can be very easy to forget to slow down and take some time to make sure that you're doing well, both physically and mentally. While we were brainstorming ways to combat this, we came up with the idea of having a website that sends out positive text messages of encouragement to lift us up, brighten our day, and remind us to take life one day at a time.

## What's next for Affirmations
There are a lot of ways that we hope to improve Affirmations in the future. Some of them include allowing the user to request for Affirmations to send them random messages throughout the day, and adding new messages of affirmation (including seasonal limited-time only messages).
